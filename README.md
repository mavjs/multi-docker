# About
This repository tries to build 2 or more container images with one github actions workflow.

Inspired by JÃ¶rgen Maas' work in:
* https://github.com/systemx-io/docker-syslog-collector
* https://github.com/systemx-io/docker-syslog-retention

Steps to get multi Dockerfile build and push is referenced from: [Building Multiple Docker Images Using Automatic Versioning Using GitHub Actions](https://mischavandenburg.com/zet/articles/building-multiple-docker-images-using-automatic-versioning-using-github-actions/) by Mischa van den Burg's blog post.
